### What is Freicoin? ###

Freicoin is a peer-to-peer (p2p) currency based on the cryptographic concept of a [proof-of-work block chain](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto, the original developer of [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/).

Unlike Bitcoin, Freicoin has a [demurrage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29) fee that ensures its circulation and bearers of the currency pay this fee automatically.

You can download, review and improve the code of this free software project [from Github](https://github.com/freicoin/freicoin).

### Why Freicoin? ###

We think the economics of bitcoin can be improved. Some of our concerns are explained below.

#### Basic interest as an economic rent ####

Capital yields tend to equal interest rates just as prices tend to equal costs. Capital yields would be like the “selling price” of investments and interest rates its costs. Economic theory tell us that all [economic profits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_profit) tend to zero in [perfect competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition). So capital yields should tend to zero as different production goods of the same type compete with each other.

As [Silvio Gesell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell) discovered, there’s a basic interest component in interest rates that doesn’t have to do with the inflation rate or the risk of the loan. Also called liquidity premium by other economists, this come from the fact that, being money non perishable and scarce, one shouldn’t rationally lend it at zero interest, even if there was no risk in the loan. So the basic interest causes an [economic rent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent) not only for money holders and lenders but for all capital owners as it impedes yields from dropping to zero. Demurrage aims to suppress the basic interest.

#### Velocity stability ####

According to the [quantitive monetary theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange), prices depend on money velocity. Demurrage encourages circulation and springs a higher and more stable velocity. So prices should be more stable for a currency with demurrage.

### Positive interest and short-term thinking ###

Some austrian economists claim that the basic interest can be explained by what they call “time preference.” They maintain that people always prefer to have things in the present than having them in the future. That is, short-term thinking is part of human nature. This is only true for capital-money, for example, you don’t necessarily prefer fresh 1000 apples today over 1 fresh apple a day for the next 1000 days, even if that holds true for U.S. dollars.

According to [Bernard Lietaer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lietaer), this short term thinking is not inherent to humans but caused by existing monetary systems. He explain this with a [tree metaphor](http://content.wuala.com/contents/jtimon/temp/what%20do%20we%20invest%20in.jpg). Say you plant a tree today and that tree will produce $100 USD in lumber after 10 years, what are those future $100 worth today?

With 5% interest rates, $100 in 10 years are equivalent to $61.39 today. That’s why we value more things in the present and this hasn’t always to be the case. The following table completes his example:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Future value of the tree adjusted to today…</th>
      <th>in 10 years</th>
      <th>in 100 years</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>…with 0% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$100.00</td>
      <td>$1000.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>…with 0% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$61.39</td>
      <td>$7.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>…with 0% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$167.02</td>
      <td>$168,903.82</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As we can see, positive interest rates cause us to value short-term returns, and if there where negative interest rates the financial market would make us value things in the future more than in the present.

#### Tragedy of the commons with fees? ####

A [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) type of market failure when all the bitcoins are issued and the block subsidies for miners ends has [been considered](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons) by the bitcoin community. It assumes that the maximum number of transactions per block is removed or increased, but Freicoin doesn’t have to fear that as there will be a perpetual reward for miners that comes from compensating for the coins “destroyed” by the demurrage fees.

### Current state of Freicoin ###

#### Beta testing ####

We’re currently testing the main changes that were needed to implement Freicoin as a fork of the Bitcoin project. Please, help us test the beta. You can find more information about this in [this thread of freicoin forums](http://www.freicoin.org/freicoin-beta-testing-t34.html).

Remember that the coins that are generated during the testing period will be lost, so don’t buy them. Difficulty is low, but just ask for some to play with there if you can’t mine them.

### Pre-release discussion ###

Apart from the changes already under testing, there are two more issues that need to be discussed and reach community consensus before the official release.

#### How freicoins are generated? ####

There’s infinite possibilities for the total supply and miner’s reward curves. How long should it take to reach the stable supply from which what is “destroyed” by demurrage equals what is “created” in block rewards? How fast should rewards decrease? Should we try to eliminate the discontinuities such as when the subsidy is halved?

These and more related questions are being discussed in [this thread](http://www.freicoin.org/freicoin-generation-graph-t41.html).

#### Who gets the demurrage fees? ####

Will the demurrage in equilibrium be enough to secure the network? Will it be too much?
If it is too much, how can we distribute the remaining in a fair and/or decentralized way?

This is being discussed in several related threads:

### Is Freicoin in competition with Bitcoin? ###

Yes and no.

#### A free monetary market ####

We believe that there should be a free monetary market and monetary diversity. In this respect, yes, Freicoin and Bitcoin will compete with each other for users as a currency. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t use both or that one of them has to necessarily disappear. In any case, that’s for you and the rest of the market to decide, not us, the bitcoin community or any state to decide.

Silvio Gesell [thought](http://www.community-exchange.org/docs/Gesell/en/neo/) that money was a natural monopoly and thus the state should operate it. But we disagree with him on that point. Thousands of [complementary currencies](http://www.complementarycurrency.org/ccDatabase/) in circulation are a living proof that this is not the case.

Most austrian economist don’t believe in a monetary monopoly, even if it’s based on gold. [E.C. Riegel](http://www.newapproachtofreedom.info/) was a strong opponent of state monopoly money. [Bernard Lietaer thinks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykvRceBQRl8) that not only competition but also diversity is important for the efficiency and resiliance of a market economy. There are many other inspirations to defend a free monetary market.

#### Free software and collaboration ####

[Free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is the software that respects your freedom as a user, but is also very well suited for collaboration. Freicoin is a fork of Bitcoin because we don’t want to compete with it technically. The technical improvements we develop will be submitted to the bitcoin repository, and we will draw upon new developments in bitcoin.

Our software development relationship with the bitcoin community is based on collaboration, not competition.

#### Merged mining ####

We don’t compete with bitcoin for miners neither. The [merged mining](http://dot-bit.org/Merged_Mining) technology first developed for namecoin allows miners to use their proof of work in several blockchain networks at the same time.

We’re currently evaluating the tradeoff between security and the convenience of having merged mining included from the beginning. Since some new chains have been attacked by bitcoin pools (even without the users of that pool knowing it) and merged mining makes new currencies vulnerable to such attacks. Even if Freicoin isn’t merge-mined with bitcoin from the beginning, it will be near future.

The result is more security for both Freicoin and Bitcoin.

**Have you ever noticed that the majority of people where you live seem to be in debt?** You may be in debt yourself and have some guilt about it. Or, perhaps, you may have never had debt and believe that being in debt reflects poorly on a person's character. However, being in debt is not immoral; it is rather the foundation of civilization. If no person or agency were ever in debt to another, not very much would be achieved. This observation is key to the understanding that a demurrage currency serving the interests of the indebted majority would in turn support a lasting, durable civilization. Our two goals are to create a currency which keeps interest rates low, benefiting debtors, and simultaneously encourages investment, benefiting everyone.
