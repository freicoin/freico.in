<h1>Frequently asked questions about Freicoin</h1>

<h3>Monetary system</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What's wrong with the modern financial system?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> In the current system, money is created by private organizations (banks), which lend the money to people. This generates inequality - some have to earn the money, while others get it automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> But money is created by the government, isn't it?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> No. The government does not create money. Paper money is printed by an independent agency, called the Central Bank. But cash only counts for 3% of all money. Most of it is electronic/digital money. Commercial banks create the money when we give them credits. This means the government has almost no control over the money distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What you're saying doesn't sound reasonable. It can't be right?!<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> These facts have been confirmed by many researches. For example, <a href="http://www.positivemoney.org/">Positive Money</a> according to the UK economy and <a href="http://www.webofdebt.com/">Web Of Debt</a> according to the US economy. You can watch the documentary <a href="http://youtu.be/jqvKjsIxT_8">Money As Debt</a> if you're still in doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> So what is the Solution?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> A gift based economy would probably be a better one, but such an economy can't be deployed rapidly. Right now we suggest that you consider Freicoin. In Freicoin, the money creation process is controlled by mathematical algorithms, implemented in the Freicoin software. It's a result of the modern achievements by mankind - powerful computing systems, distributed networks and applied cryptography.</p>

<h3>Freicoin currency</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why freicoin using demurrage? I bother about melting coins.<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Bother? Is good. If money are stable, people prefer save them and don't spend. This decreasing money quantity in economics lead to violation of main purpose of money - medium of exchange. With demurrage you should think about money as they are, not as about treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How big this demurrage fee?<br/>

<strong>A:</strong> You are right. But we have no other solution. Initial coins should be distributed in society.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> You can just give these coins to miners (as in Bitcoin). Why need a bureaucracy?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Miners is only thin category of enthusiasts, not ordinary people who uses computer to browse Internet.</p>
