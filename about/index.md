<p> The Arctic Tern is a mysterious seabird. The Tern’s flight is so efficient that the Tern can sleep in the air. Every year it migrates so far it could fly the circumference of the planet twice, but it always returns to the same place, the same colony. </p>
<p>One of the main locations of the Tern’s colony is on Iceland, which is a special place to people that identify with OWS and debt-free money.</p>    
<p>Our money should behave in the exact same way. Our money should be more like an Arctic Tern. Real money doesn’t have an owner; it behaves like an independent living being. Living money, like Freicoin, circulates quickly and forever.</p>

    <p><img class="even" style="float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:1em;" src="/static/images/oasis.jpg"><strong>Freicoin is an implementation of Bitcoin which loses 5% of its value per year.</strong> Why on Earth would anyone want their money to lose value? The rationale is to separate store-of-value from medium-of-exchange definitions of money, which is what Freicoin accomplishes.</p>
<p>Demurrage currencies like Freicoin align incentives of bankers and financiers with the priorities of the working class. A complete electronic economy, including demurrage currency, will also not fall victim to to the same greed, excess, and short-term thinking that led to the 2008 crisis and financial collapse. Freicoin will continuously stimulate global growth through reinvestment, and dis-incentivize the paralysis that caused the "credit crunch". </p>
<p>Freicoin exists to expand the boundries of the crypto-currency oasis to envelop a greater part of the traditional economy.</p>

    <p><img class="odd" style="float:left;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em;" src="/static/images/occupy.jpg"><strong>Have you ever noticed that the majority of people where you live seem to be in debt?</strong> You may be in debt yourself and have some guilt about it. Or, perhaps, you may have not have any debt and believe that being in debt reflects poorly on a person's character. However, being in debt is not immoral; it's the foundation of civilization. If we were never in debt to one another, not very much would be achieved.</p>
    <p>This observation is key to understanding that a demurrage currency would serve the interests of the indebted majority. Our two goals are to define a currency which keeps interest rates low, benefiting debtors, and encourages investment, benefiting everyone.</p>
    <p>Demurrage forces the entire stock of money to circulate irrespective of the desire of the wealthy to accumulate and store. Banks, financiers, and corporations can no longer hoard money waiting for higher interest rates or a more favorable investment climate. The demurrage acts as a tax on stagnant money, so anybody that has it is highly motivated to spend it on the necessities of life, or to invest in longer-term ventures that also provide stimulus for a growing economy, creating real jobs in the process. Real money becomes a sort of "hot potato" that is passed around as quickly as possible, in a virtuous cycle of investment. No longer are there incentives for financiers to withhold credit from those in need simply to want for fairer economic winds.</p>
<p>In fact, the economic advantage of simply being wealthy is diminished with Freicoin. The current systems of money, including the U.S. Dollar or Euro, are used to store value. Because these world currencies are inflationary, the reduction in currency value is diverted to raise interest rates. Freicoin transforms this value from idle speculation to productive investment.
Freicoin shifts the balance, from simple wealth to merit. The wealthy will become servants to their money in an eternal search for projects with a real economic benefit. For example, we believe the Internal Rate of Return of an complete adult education outpaces anything you could achieve on the Stock Market. Providing zero percent interest loans to students for an education would be a sublime wealth preservation strategy with a Freicoin economy.</p>
<p>Where does the destroyed money go? Freicoin diverts the excess to the diligent accountants (or miners) who are responsible for maintaining the global ledger of electronic transactions. This incentive means it is very difficult, both technologically and economically, to manipulate Freicoin as we have seen with the legacy economy.</p>

    <p><img class="even" style="float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-bottom:1em;" src="/static/images/silvio.jpg"><strong>Demurrage, or Freigeld, was first tried by theoretical economist, social activist, and anarchist, Silvio Gesell.</strong> Gesell discovered that interest rates aren't only based on the inflation rate or the risk of the loan. Called the liquidity premium by economists, money is nonperishable and scarce, so one shouldn't rationally lend it at zero interest. Demurrage aims to suppress this basic interest by making money perishable, like a consumer good.</p>
<p>As a consequence of having perishable money, anything that is not perishable becomes much more valuable. </p>
<p>If you follow the news, you know the world is in an economic depression or recession. Even with this condition, the risk-free interest rate is 3%! Even during the Great Depression these rates only decreased to two percent. When the economy gets hot these rates reach as high as 15%. Thus, consumable products are perpetually overvalued, and sustainable products are always undervalued.</p>

<p>With high interest rates it pays to be a vulture capitalist. Forests are clear-cut rather than sustainably harvested. Small businesses with real products are purchased, their machines are sold off to competitors, and the company is loaded down with impossible debts and left to die. Centuries old buildings are demolished for parking lots. Essentially high interest rates fund the destruction of capital. Freicoin enables a sustainable society by being perishable.</p>
