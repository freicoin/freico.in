    <h2>What&nbsp;is Freicoin?</h2>

    <p>Freicoin is a decentralized, distributed electronic currency designed to address grievances of the working class and re-align financial interests with the stability and well-being of the economy as a whole. Whereas inflationary currency like the U.S. Dollar or Euro are controlled by central bankers under rules that intentionally or not benefit the establishment, Freicoin is completely decentralized and self-regulating, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29">demurrage fee</a> that ensures its circulation and bearers of the currency pay this fee automatically to those community members who contribute work to secure the currency. It includes a <a href="/download/">downloadable client</a> for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, and an electronic network for transferring funds denominated in Freicoin world-wide.</p>

      <p>The Arctic Tern is a unique seabird: the Tern’s flight is so efficient and stable that the Tern can sleep in the air, and its navigation so precise that every year it migrates so far it could fly the circumference of the planet twice, but it always returns to the same place, the same colony.</p>

      <p>One of the main locations of the Tern’s colony is on Iceland, which is a special place to people that identify with <em>Occupy: Wall St.</em> and debt-free money.</p>

      <p>Our money should behave like the Arctic Tern: circulate the globe, moving with stability and efficiency, without coercive control, operating at both the global and local scale.</p>

Why&nbsp;use *Freicoin*?
------------------------

**[Demurrage currencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29) like Freicoin align incentives of bankers and financiers with the priorities of the working class, incentivising the wealthy through their own self-interest to invest in growth, jobs, and ventures with long-term thinking**. An economy built on demurrage currency as the essential foundation will also not fall victim to to the same usurious greed, excess, and short-term thinking that led to the 2008 crisis and financial collapse. Freicoin will continuously stimulate global growth through reinvestment, and dis-incentivize actions which led to and furthered the paralysis that caused the “credit crunch.”

In fact, the economic advantages of simply being wealthy is diminished with Freicoin. The current system of money, including the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and other national currencies, currency is and always has been used to store value--money seen from the point of view of the holders, the wealthy. Freicoin emphasizes instead the view to that of the producer, the proletariat, the 99%: money as a means of buying the goods and services necessary to sustain life, and the capital required to create improved living conditions. These are contrary purposes--money cannot function properly as, nor should it ever be both a means of saving and exchange; it cannot be both accelerator and brake at the same time. Indeed, this confusion and conflict over the purpose of money is central to explanation of the financial collapse of 2008 and the extended recession that followed.

**Demurrage forces the entire stock of money to circulate irrespective of the desire of the usurious money-holders to accumulate and store**. Banks, financiers, and large corporations can no longer hoard money waiting for higher interest rates or a more favorable investment climate as the demurrage would act as a tax on stagnant money. Money-holders lose their privileged position at the negotiating table, and are instead given incentive to seek out productive investments in new ventures and real capital goods. Under demurrage money is eternally losing value, so the incentive is to spend or invest it as soon as possible on the necessities of life or in longer-term ventures that also provide stimulus for a growing economy, typically creating real jobs in the process. Demurrage money becomes a sort of “hot potato” that is passed around as quickly as possible, in a virtuous cycle of investment and consumption. No longer are there incentives for financiers to withhold credit from those in need simply to wait for fairer economic winds or a better negotiating position.

<img class="odd" style="float:left;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em;" src="/static/images/occupy.jpg">
**For the 99% who live paycheck-to-paycheck, the loss from demurrage is minimal and would be compensated for in wages and pricing**. For those who manage to accumulate some savings and for the 1% who receive much more income than they reasonably spend, they can either save real wealth (gold, silver, Bitcoins, real estate, artwork and fine wine, for example) and accept the obvious limitations of wealth saving (loss, storage, rot, fire, insurance premiums, etc.), or they can loan it out to borrowers at what ends up being near-zero basic interest. With sustainable 0%-APR interest loans the order of the day, businesses will boom and the economy will grow in a virtuous cycle.

**Freicoin provides a perpetual security subsidy**. A somewhat esoteric technical argument in favor of Freicoin: a [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) type of market failure when all the bitcoins are issued and the block subsidies for miners ends has [been considered](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons) by the Bitcoin community. It assumes that the maximum number of transactions per block is removed or greatly increased, but Freicoin doesn’t have to fear such an event as there will be a perpetual reward for miners that comes from compensating for the coins “destroyed” by the demurrage fees. While it is not clear how this situation could affect Bitcoin, Freicoin won't suffer this problem.

So far in this explanation we have dealt with the unique advantages of Freicoin specifically, but as a Bitcoin-derived crypto-currency, Freicoin shares with it many advantages over national currencies. Both digital currencies provide a predictable, limited and stable monetary supply and 24/7/365 operation (compared with banking), abolish centralized control over that money supply, dis-allow chargebacks or seizure of assets, provide fast transfers with low transaction costs (Freicoin's are expected to be even lower than Bitcoin's), and enable pseudo-anonymous use for private transactions.

How&nbsp;does it&nbsp;work?
---------------------------

**Freicoin is an implementation of Bitcoin which loses approximately 5% of its value per year.** The destroyed money simply vanishes, being permanently taken out of circulation. However to keep prices stable an equal-valued batch of freshly minted coins is created and distributed to the diligent accountants (the “miners”) who maintain at their own cost the global ledger of electronic transactions. The economics of mining are such that most of this is spent on the real capital required for mining, thus forcing the newly minted coins to flow back into the economy. The subsidized mining incentive incentive drives participation, making it very difficult, both technologically and economically, to manipulate Freicoin as is done with the legacy systems of money in use today.

  <dt>What is Bitcoin?</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> is a decentralized, peer-to-peer internet currency secured by strong cryptography and an open-source development process, and the foundational technology underlying Freicoin. Bitcoin enables anyone in the world to send funds to anyone else with minimal, fair fees on both consumers and merchants. Bitcoin is democratic in that everyone who uses the currency takes part in securing it (making sure the rules are followed and there is no fraud) by running a software program on their computers; they are proportionally compensated for this effort by collecting transaction fees, and in the case of Freicoin, demurrage. For more information about the benefits that come from basing Freicoin on Bitcoin technology, see the Bitcoin advocacy site <a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/">We Use Coins</a>.</dd>

Why&nbsp;does it&nbsp;work?
---------------------------

Examples of [demurrage-money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_%28currency%29) can be found throughout history, all the way back into antiquity. For a historical treatment of the subject, we suggest reading David Graeber's anthropological work [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years).

Demurrage-money was re-introduced in the modern era by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century by the theoretical economist, social activist, and anarchist, [Silvio Gesell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell). Gesell discovered that interest rates aren't based solely on the inflation rate and the risk of the loan. Called the liquidity premium by economists, the difference is due to money being nonperishable, scarce, and universally accepted, so rational actors tend to demand extra interest to make up for the opportunity cost of lending money. Gesell showed that this usurious premium, the economic rent of basic interest, is the root cause of the non-utilization of resources that leads to dysfunctional institutions and makes the boom/bust business cycle inevitable.

Gesell's [proposed solution](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order) included *Freigeld* (“free-money”), a paper demurrage currency that suppressed this basic interest by making money perishable, like a consumer good. The basic idea has been tested [several times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worgl_Experiment#The_W.C3.B6rgl_Experiment) with [positive results](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiemgauer).

**As a consequence of having a perishable money supply, anything that is not perishable becomes much more valuable**. If you follow the news, you know the world is in an economic depression or recession. Even with this condition, the risk-free interest rate is 3%! Even during the Great Depression these rates only decreased to two percent. When the economy gets hot these rates reach as high as 15%. Thus, consumable products are perpetually overvalued, and sustainable products are always undervalued.

With high interest rates it pays to be a vulture capitalist. Forests are clear-cut rather than sustainably harvested. Small businesses with real products are purchased, their machines are sold off to competitors, and the company is loaded down with impossible debts and left to die. Centuries old buildings are demolished for parking lots. Essentially high interest rates fund the destruction of capital. Freicoin enables a sustainable society by safely lowering basic interest rates to zero without price inflation by means of demurrage.
