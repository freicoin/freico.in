Capital yields tend to equal interest rates just as prices tend to equal costs. Capital yields would be like the “selling price” of investments and interest rates its costs. Economic theory tell us that all [economic profits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_profit) tend to zero in [perfect competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition). So capital yields should tend to zero as different production goods of the same type compete with each other.

As [Silvio Gesell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell) discovered, there’s a basic interest component in interest rates that doesn’t have to do with the inflation rate or the risk of the loan. Also called liquidity premium by other economists, this come from the fact that, being money non perishable and scarce, one shouldn’t rationally lend it at zero interest, even if there was no risk in the loan. So the basic interest causes an [economic rent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent) not only for money holders and lenders but for all capital owners as it impedes yields from dropping to zero. Demurrage aims to suppress the basic interest.
