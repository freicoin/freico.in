A [tragedy of the commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) type of market failure when all the bitcoins are issued and the block subsidies for miners ends has [been considered](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_Commons) by the bitcoin community. It assumes that the maximum number of transactions per block is removed or increased, but Freicoin doesn’t have to fear that as there will be a perpetual reward for miners that comes from compensating for the coins “destroyed” by the demurrage fees.

While it is not clear how this situation could affect bitcoin, freicoin won't suffer this problem.
