title: Long-term thinking
description: Encourages long-term investments (as sustainable investments tend to be) by removing the time preference implicit in the basic interest.

Some austrian economists claim that the basic interest can be explained by what they call “time preference.” They maintain that people always prefer to have things in the present than having them in the future. That is, short-term thinking is part of human nature. This is only true for capital-money, for example, as you wouldn’t necessarily prefer 1000 fresh apples today over 1 fresh apple a day for the next 1000 days, even if that holds true for U.S. dollars.

According to [Bernard Lietaer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lietaer), this short term thinking is not inherent to humans but caused by some existing monetary systems. He explains this with a [tree metaphor](http://content.wuala.com/contents/jtimon/temp/what%20do%20we%20invest%20in.jpg). Say you plant a tree today and that tree will produce $100 USD in lumber after 10 years, what is that future $100 worth today?

With 5% interest rates, $100 in 10 years are equivalent to $61.39 today. That’s why we value more things in the present, although this hasn’t always been the case. The following table completes his example:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Future value of the tree adjusted to today…</th>
      <th>in 10 years</th>
      <th>in 100 years</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>…with 0% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$100.00</td>
      <td>$1000.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>…with 5% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$61.39</td>
      <td>$7.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>…with -5% interest (without adjustment, real future value)</td>
      <td>$167.02</td>
      <td>$168,903.82</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As we can see, positive interest rates cause us to value short-term returns, and if there were negative interest rates the financial market would make us value things in the future more than in the present. With 0% interest rates we could value things in the future as much as we value them in the present: money wouldn't have any effect on our “time preference,” which may change with the current circumstances of each person and his decisions.
