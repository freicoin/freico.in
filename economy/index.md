Economy
==================

Money production in Freicoin is through a process called **mining**, the execution of tasks required to keep network **running** and **secure**. Every Freicoin client is capable of performing these tasks, but in practice mining is the domain of computer enthusiasts and IT professionals with tuned top-level hardware. New money is created in **strictly limited amounts** according math algorithms implemented in the Freicoin client. The total amount of money in circulation smoothly increases during the approximately **3 years** after launch, until it **stabilizes** at 100 million coins.

During the 3-year **initial distribution**, one part of the newly created money is given to the miners in proportion to their contribution, starting at **30%** of new coins (on launch) and decreasing to **5%** (at the point of stabilization). When the network is small and young, it needs more care and attention than when it grown. The remainder is distributed through the **Freicoin Foundation**, non-profit organization aimed to promote Freicoin and support sustainable world. **80%** of the total will be distributed through the Foundation.

A small holding fee, called **demurrage**, and bearers of the currency pay this fee **automatically**. It ensures money circulation and encourages sustainable investments. These fee, **5% per year**, re-enters the economy through miners who use a large portion of it to pay for **operating costs**.
